# check-worktree-isolation.sh -- PreToolUse hook that blocks Write/Edit
# operations targeting paths outside the active worktree.
#
# When /projd-hands-off spawns a parallel-agent worker with
# isolation: worktree, the worker runs in .claude/worktrees/agent-<id>/.
# Some tools (e.g. codegen, build caches, module-aware tools) can resolve
# files relative to the enclosing module root and cause Write/Edit calls
# that target the main repo tree instead of the worktree -- producing
# stray modifications on main after the worker finishes.
#
# This hook detects a worktree session from CWD and rejects any Write/Edit
# whose file_path resolves inside the main repo but outside the active
# worktree. Paths outside the repo entirely (e.g. ~/.claude, /tmp) are
# allowed: those are not "leaks".
#
# No-op when the session CWD is not inside a worktree.
